/*-- List.h ---------------------------------------------------------------
    This header file defines the data type List for processing Doubly Circular List.
    Basic operations are:
    no arg Constructor
    Destructor
    Copy constructor
    Assignment operator
    search: returns true if the item exists in the list
    isEmpty: Check if list is empty or not
    insertAtPosition: Insert an item
    insertAtEnd: insert an item at end
    insertAtBeginning: insert an item at the beginning
    deleteAtPosition: Remove an item
    deleteAvalue: deletes the node that contains the item data
    deleteBeforeAnElement: search for the item in the list and delete
                           the node before the node where data was found
    findAndDelete: deletes all the occurences of an item data
    removefirst: cuts the first node from the list and returns its data
    removeLast: cuts the last node from the list and returns its data
    deleteDuplicates: keeps only the first occurence of an element in
                      the list and removes all the others
    display: to display the content list
    Â«: Output operator << that calls the function display and
                          display the content of the list
